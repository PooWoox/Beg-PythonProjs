# Beg-PythonProjs
A repository for simple and small Python projects I'm beginning with.

1st is a simple "Guess the Number" game. A random number between 1 and 20 is generated and the user guesses on the input. The program will inform the user when the number guessed is either too high or too low.

All project files are on the repository.
