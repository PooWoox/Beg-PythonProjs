# Beg-PythonProjs
A repository for simple and small Python projects I'm beginning with. I'm definitely open to receive suggestions for making the code of each project simpler or improved. Here to learn, thanks.

1st is a simple "Guess the Number" game. A random number between 1 and 20 is generated and the user guesses on the input. The program will inform the user when the number guessed is either too high or too low.

2nd is a "Rock, Paper and Scissors' game. PC makes its choice and the user chooses on input by typing 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors'. Program recognizes ties, wins and losses. Winning adds 1 score to player and losing adds 1 to PC score, both situations offers the player the option to continue playing or not.

3rd one is a simple login system linked to Google Sheets as a data base. This one has its own repository on my profile with a README file explaining how it works.

4th is a To do list web application using Flask, wtforms and SQLAlchemy. Still in development, will add a README file on it's folder with all the explanation once I'm done.

5th is a quiz about brazillian state capitals. The user has 3 chances to get all of them correct. Input has to be written exactly how the city is named, with capital letters on the beginning. Once the user gets a correct answer, +1 score is added and this state is removed from the list so it wont be repeated. Game ends when the user has no chances left or the score is maxed (26).

All project files are on the repository.
