# Beg-PythonProjs
A repository for simple and small Python projects I'm beginning with. I'm definitely open to receive suggestions for making the code of each project simpler or improved. Here to learn, thanks.

1st is a simple "Guess the Number" game. A random number between 1 and 20 is generated and the user guesses on the input. The program will inform the user when the number guessed is either too high or too low.

2nd is a "Rock, Paper and Scissors' game. PC makes its choice and the user chooses on input by typing 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors'. Program recognizes ties, wins and losses. Winning adds 1 score to player and losing adds 1 to PC score, both situations offers the player the option to continue playing or not.

3rd one is a simple login system linked to Google Sheets as a data base. This one has its own repository on my profile with a README file explaining how it works.

All project files are on the repository.
